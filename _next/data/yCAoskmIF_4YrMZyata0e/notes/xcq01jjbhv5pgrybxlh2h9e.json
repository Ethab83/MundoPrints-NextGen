The website is a type of online shopping platform, so it would be useful to have this architecture. The model in this case is a database to store information about customers and printers, as well as inventory, and available designs. As for deployment, it will be hosted on WP.</p>\n<p>The exact implementation of the architecture is managed by WP. We chose WP because it made the most sense to copy the existing website (for other printed products) <a href=\"https://www.mundoprints.in/\">MundoPrints.in</a>, to <a href=\"https://mundocards.wpcomstaging.com/\">MundoCards.com</a> and change it to meet the requirements</p>\n<h2 id=\"technologies-and-implementation-details\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#technologies-and-implementation-details\"></a>Technologies and Implementation Details</h2>\n<p>Since we are using WP most of the implementation will be inside WP and WP plugins. We are using the Elementor plugin to develop the front-end. Elementor is a drag and drop editor which makes it fairly easy to create a web UI. For managing products and customers we are using WC. For the design page we are using Zakeke which is a tailor made plugin for printing template customization. For the payment processing, we are using the RazorPay plugin for WP. For notifying customers for order confirmation and delivery, we are using Zoho Campaigns. For managing vendors and\nimplementing the vendor dashboard, we are using WC Vendors.</p>\n<h2 id=\"user-interface\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#user-interface\"></a>User Interface</h2>\n<p>Drawing inspiration from the layout of MundoPrints.in, which is still in development, we meticulously refined the user interface to cater specifically to our product offerings. Given the diverse range of products such as logo tees, brochures, and more, we carefully pruned unnecessary UI elements and crafted a new menu bar.</p>\n<p>Our revamped menu bar now boasts essential options such as 'Home', 'About Us', 'Contact', 'Privacy Policy', 'Vendor Login', and 'Cart', ensuring seamless navigation for our users. To accentuate the shopping experience, we strategically placed the cart logo adjacent to the menu bar, adding a visual cue for easy access.</p>\n<p>In the product gallery, we sought to strike the perfect balance between aesthetics and functionality.

Pixel-perfect adjustments ensure that the images are crisp and legible, elevating the overall visual appeal.To empower users with control over their browsing experience, we introduced 'Default Sorting' options and a button leading to a comprehensive product view. </p>\n<p>Harnessing the power of the 'Edit with Elementor' feature from WordPress, we seamlessly executed these enhancements, ensuring a user-centric design that is both elegant and intuitive.</p>","noteIndex":{"id":"ylznqpn1jrbvdkq1g5ben10","title":"ðŸ“ƒ  Overview","desc":"","updated":1713818891086,"created":1713714630159,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"overview","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"ea7c6ddd0b13ae935d04691b5abc6df9","links":[],"anchors":{"quick-links":{"type":"header","text":"Quick Links","value":"quick-links","line":8,"column":0,"depth":2},"definitions":{"type":"header","text":"Definitions","value":"definitions","line":14,"column":0,"depth":2},"scope":{"type":"header","text":"Scope","value":"scope","line":26,"column":0,"depth":2},"overview":{"type":"header","text":"Overview","value":"overview","line":32,"column":0,"depth":2},"limitations":{"type":"header","text":"Limitations","value":"limitations","line":36,"column":0,"depth":2},"requirements":{"type":"header","text":"Requirements","value":"requirements","line":48,"column":0,"depth":2},"specifications":{"type":"header","text":"Specifications","value":"specifications","line":60,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["xcq01jjbhv5pgrybxlh2h9e","l1udgesawkypusqo4dn65fd","q7dorodf01lzbobzeshnouw","fff95qwwpngi2n6tkrgeg14"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\n## Quick Links\n\n- [MundoCards Homepage](https://mundocards.wpcomstaging.com/)\n- [WordPress Dashboard](https://mundocards.wpcomstaging.com/wp-admin/)\n- [Project Task Board](https://github.com/users/Ethab83/projects/1)\n\n## Definitions\n\n- **API**: Application Programming Interface\n- **E-commerce**: Electronic commerce\n- **iOS**: iPhone OS (Operating System)\n- **MVC**: Model, View, Controller\n- **MVP**: Minimum Viable Product\n- **SaaS**: Software as a Service\n- **UI**: User Interface\n- **WC**: WooComerce (e-commerce platform on top of WP)\n- **WP**: WordPress\n\n## Scope\n\n- **MundoCards Web-App**: A WP/WC SaaS web-app that facilitates on-demand printing services for consumers and local printers in emerging markets. The platform aims to aggregate consumer demand and automate the printersâ€™ workflows through a SaaS web portal. The website should have a User-friendly UI and a secured payment API.\n- **Consumer-end**: The business card designer software will be used to customize business cards that will be sold using the MundoPrints platform. The software will make it simple for customers to use MundoPrints from any device (mobile/desktop) easily.\n- **Producer-end**: The printers/vendors will use a dashboard to manage their orders and product stock.\n\n## Overview\n\nThis project (MundoCards), is for a Software Engineering class project at UMass Boston. Through the MundoCards platform, the user can customize their Business Cards according to their own requirements. Our task is to build an efficient website to incorporate as many customization features as we can for the business cards and secured payment process.\n\n## Limitations\n\nNavigating the regulatory landscape across different countries can be challenging, with varying standards, taxes, and import/export regulations potentially complicating operations and expansion plans. One problem like this that we have run into was initially we were using a US-based WP website. However, we ended up switching this to an India-based WP website, because it was both cheaper, and more fitting. We will soon be implementing the payment system, and it will be important to make sure that the prices are shown in rupees instead of dollars.\n\nManaging an efficient supply chain across diverse and sometimes remote areas can be complex, with risks of delays, increased costs, and logistical challenges affecting the timely delivery of services. This may not be much of a concern for us, since it will take too long to track the entire order fulfillment before the final deadline.\n\nManaging the services, and website across different regions due to language barriers. Since the site is targeted towards the Indian market, it will be a challenge to make sure everything looks right.\n\nEnsuring consistency with the product quality and packaging across all the different regions we are providing services to.\n\nWP itself presents many limitations which are pay-walled behind subscriptions. We have run into several problems with limitations of some subscription levels, however with out current subscription, there are no further issues.\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe most important requirement of this project is to create a user-friendly web-app that enables customers to customize their business cards according to their needs. To implement the website we are using WP.\n\nThe web-app must have a product navigation and customization UI for customers, and an orders dashboard for printing vendors.\n\nThe payment process must be smooth and secure for safety and reliability purposes. For this we are using WP plugins WC and RazorPay.\n\nThe website should be functional on all sorts of devices including a desktop or a phone(iOS/Android) Thankfully WP makes this fairly easy.\nFrom the back-end perspective, the website should be able to connect the user with the local printers well, with all the order information and delivery notifications being sent to both parties at the same time. For this we are using the WP plugin called Zoho Campaigns.\nLastly, the website should also be able to track the details of the customers and store them in the database for future reference. For this we are using a WP plugin called JetPack.\n\n## Specifications\n\nThe software will be implemented on a website [MundoCards.com](https://mundocards.wpcomstaging.com/). It will be accessible from the homepage of it. The very first step in the process was to find out how we were going to build the website. We decided to use WP (with the Creator plan) because it could easily be used to implement the front-end design and add functionality through existing plugins. We copied the existing (unfinished) website. After obtaining the domain, we researched the specific plugins to implement (for payment processing, card customization, vendor dashboards, customer notification, etc.). Now, we are currently integrating the plugins to work seamlessly with the web-app.\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart"}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":"vault"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"dendronVersion":"0.95.0","enableEditorDecorations":true,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"enableHandlebarTemplates":false,"templateHierarchy":"template","enableSmartRefs":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"logoPath":"logo.png","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.webp","enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"assetsPrefix":"/MundoPrints-Visiting.Cards","copyAssets":true,"siteIndex":"overview","siteHierarchies":["overview","integrations","maintinence","pricing"],"enableSiteLastModified":true,"siteRootDir":"docs","siteUrl":"https://ethab83.github.io","enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["vault"]},"writeStubs":false,"seo":{"title":"MundoCards Documentation","description":"All documentation relating to MundoCards.com"},"github":{"enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree"},"enablePrettyLinks":true,"theme":"custom","enableTaskNotes":true,"templateVersion":"0.97.0","enableMermaid":true,"searchMode":"lookup"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
