## Plans / Pricing

> Adapted from [Dokan Pricing](https://dokan.co/wordpress/pricing/)

Pricing is identical in India and the US, however since sales tax is 18% in India, it would be more cost effective to purchase from the US.

The **Business Plan** is the only plan which meets all requirements for MundoCards since it is the cheapest subscription which provides vendor geolocation (which allows customer to search for vendor based on location).

**Price**: 51,788.00 INR / 619.52 USD (18% tax included)

**Features**:

- Vendor geolocation
- Single product, multiple vendors
