- **March 10th**: recieve the existing codebase for the old website. This will be our next big milestone as it will mark the start of our implementation phase.
    - We initially received the website on March 6th. However there were many limitations with the subscription plan, so after researching possible solutions and deciding that purchasing a higher-tier subscription through WP India. It wasnâ€™t until March 22nd when we received access to the final website.
- **March 20th**: complete R&D for the existing integrations/plugins used, so that we can easily integrate them onto the new website.
    - We were able to research the existing WP plugins by this deadline, though there are extra plugins we have added and have just one more plugin to research.
- **April 25th**: produce a MVP for MundoCards.
